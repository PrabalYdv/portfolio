    <section id="about">
      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        I am a professional and detail-oriented software developer with a strong
        sense of responsibility and ownership. I believe that good software is
        built through clarity of thought, clean execution, and consistent effort.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over time, I have developed the ability to balance technical depth with
        leadership responsibilities. I enjoy mentoring others, structuring
        workflows, and ensuring that both people and systems operate efficiently.
      </p>

      <p>
        I approach every project with a long-term mindset, focusing on
        maintainability, scalability, and real-world usability rather than
        shortcuts or temporary solutions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="ideology">
      <h2>Ideology & Work Ethic</h2>

      <p>
        I believe strong teams are built on trust, communication, and shared
        accountability. I value environments where learning is encouraged and
        feedback is treated as a tool for growth.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am adaptable, dependable, and solution-driven. When challenges arise,
        I focus on understanding the problem deeply before designing structured
        and practical solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        My goal is always to contribute positively — not only through code, but
        also through collaboration, leadership, and consistency.
