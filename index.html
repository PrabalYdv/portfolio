    <!-- ABOUT -->
    <section class="panel active">
      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I am a professional and detail-oriented software developer with a strong
        sense of responsibility, ownership, and long-term thinking. I believe
        that good software is built through clarity of thought, clean execution,
        and consistent effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, I have developed the ability to balance deep technical work
        with leadership responsibilities. I enjoy mentoring others, structuring
        workflows, and ensuring that both people and systems operate efficiently.
      </p>
      <p>
        I approach every project with a long-term mindset, focusing on
        maintainability, scalability, and real-world usability rather than
        shortcuts or temporary solutions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- IDEOLOGY -->
    <section class="panel">
      <h3>Ideology & How I Think</h3>
      <p>
        I believe strong teams are built on trust, communication, and shared
        accountability. I value environments where learning is encouraged and
        feedback is treated as a tool for growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am adaptable, dependable, and solution-driven. When challenges arise,
        I focus on understanding the problem deeply before designing structured
        and practical solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is always to contribute positively — not only through code, but
        also through collaboration, leadership, and consistency.
